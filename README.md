# datatoolboxexos

This repository contains the data and code I used during CESAB datatoolbox workshop

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

-   [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version, `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures and tables in this file)
-   [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
-   [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other illustrations
-   [:file\_folder: supplementary-materials](/analysis/supplementary-materials): Supplementary materials including notes and other documents prepared and collected during the analysis.

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mrelnoob/datatoolboxexos/master?urlpath=rstudio) to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL: [master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping: - open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio - run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). - finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console
